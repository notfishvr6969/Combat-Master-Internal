## Overview

This is a simple internal cheat for the Unity game Combat Master, it has a basic SDK
with information gathered reversing the game itself and Unity Engine.

It contains the following basic features (Open to contribution)

- ESP (Snaplines + Text)
- Aimbot with adjustable smoothing
- Watermark
- Break AI Pathfinding
- Debug Logger

- Press `Insert` to toggle the menu.  
- Toggleboxes and buttons are used to activate features

I made this project for fun, others may learn something from it, or even use it as a base to make their own cheat for this game. I thought it would be a fun little project, the SDK included allows you to easily add things from various other classes i haven't reversed yet along with other unknown types making it easily expandable.

TODO

- Distinguish players by team ID (Look at GetTeamID() function in older unobfuscated metadata game builds)
- Adjust aimbot to correct height with player positions from head transform
- Identify player names, health, other fields, etc.. (Reversed from PlayerRoot)
